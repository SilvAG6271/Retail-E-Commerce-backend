## Credits 
Got some code from Eli, the instructor for our class, for the models. Used the driver's license and libary card exercises to help set up routes and complete models. Did also compare to Josh's (https://github.com/stanjosh) from class and user njthanhtrang (https://github.com/njthanhtrang) to fix minor issues in tag-routes.js.
